# Online-Forever - Streaming edition
IN WORK, DOSEN'T WORK RIGHT NOW
Make your Discord Account 24/7 Online with a custom stream status
Before anything, please note it's forked from https://github.com/SealedSaucer/Online-Forever and i'm just putting a custom stream status

----

A code written in Python that helps you to keep your account 24/7 online with a stream status.

The [main.py](https://github.com/SealedSaucer/Online-Forever/blob/main/main.py) is the main file. [keep_alive.py](https://github.com/SealedSaucer/Online-Forever/blob/main/keep_alive.py) prevents your repl from going to sleep. (If you have a replit hacker plan, then you can delete [this file](https://github.com/SealedSaucer/Online-Forever/blob/main/keep_alive.py) and paste this code inside the [main.py](https://github.com/SealedSaucer/Online-Forever/blob/main/main.py) file: 

</br>

```py
import discord
import os
from discord.ext import commands

client = commands.Bot(command_prefix=':', self_bot=True, help_command=None)

@client.event
async def on_ready():
  await client.change_presence(status=discord.Status.online)
  os.system('clear')
  print(f'Logged in as {client.user} (ID: {client.user.id})')

client.run(os.getenv("TOKEN"))
```

### DO NOT GIVE YOUR TOKEN TO OTHERS!

#### Giving your token to someone else will give them the ability to log into your account without the password or 2FA.
